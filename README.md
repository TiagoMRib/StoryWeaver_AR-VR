This project is a no-code authoring tool that allows non-technical users to create immersive narratives for both Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Built around the concept of virtual choreographies, it separates abstract story logic from platform-specific behaviors through a manifest-based architecture.
Built on top of Miguel Freitasâ€™ StoryWeaver, originally developed for AR-based storytelling and cultural heritage experiences.
